## Spiral primes
Problem 58

Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

37 36 35 34 33 32 31  
38 17 16 15 14 13 30  
39 18 _5 _4 _3 12 29  
40 19 _6 _1 _2 11 28  
41 20 _7 _8 _9 10 27  
42 21 22 23 24 25 26  
43 44 45 46 47 48 49  

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

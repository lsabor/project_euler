# project_euler
Solution code to the problem bank from https://projecteuler.net/

Project details:
Started March 5, 2022
Uses Python 3.10.0 or later
The intention is to proceed through problems 1-100 from archives https://projecteuler.net/archives/ in order. That may be subject to change.

File Structure:
/project_euler
    README.md
    requirements.txt
    /modules/
        maths.py    <- helper modules that get used multiple times
    /00__s/
        0000.ipynb  <- example solution
        0001.ipynb  <- solution to problem 1
        0002.ipynb
        ...
        0099.ipynb
    /0100s/         <- this will only continue privately, see note below
        0100.ipynb
        ...
        0199.ipynb
    ...


From the conditions of using the website, one cannot publish solutions to problems past problem 100.
"""
Please do not deprive others of going through the same process by publishing your solution outside of Project Euler. Members found to be spoiling problems beyond the first one-hundred problems will have their accounts locked.
"""
I intend to continue soliving problems pas 100, but will put those solutions in a private repository viewable only upon request.
